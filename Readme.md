# SE Template

Basic SE template to use when creating Script-Extender based mods. Automatically imports Community Library Lua Utility functions and dictionaries.

Recommended to use Visual Studio Code, and follow [These Steps](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModdingTools/wiki/Script-Extender-Lua-Setup) to set up your VSCode to better handle working with SE. 

Add these files to your reference scripts folder:
- [Osi.lua](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModdingTools/blob/master/generated/Osi.lua)
- [Osi.Events.lua](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModdingTools/blob/master/generated/Osi.Events.lua)
- [CL_LuaLib.lua](https://github.com/BG3-Community-Library-Team/BG3-Community-Library/blob/main/ReferenceScripts/CL_LuaLib.lua)

## Installation
This mod works with [Baldur's Gate 3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), and possibly Vortex and Manual
Installations. BG3 Mod Managers is by far the simplest method, and as such is recommended one.
